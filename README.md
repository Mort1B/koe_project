# KÃ¸ Project
As part of our final project for </Salt>, we were given two weeks to tackle a challenge the COVID19 pandemic created. Our application is a live stream, centralised platform that allow businesses to update their current venue capacity to customers in order to ensure safe social distancing and maintain good public health and safety. 
Our app was created  using the following tech stack- 

- MongoDB 
- Firebase
- GraphQL
- Apollo Server
- Express

Our team is  Eugene Hutornuk, Morten Bergseng, and Na Wei, and our application can be found at https://fierce-retreat-29938.herokuapp.com/index.html
